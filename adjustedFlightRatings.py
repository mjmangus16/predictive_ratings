def adjust_flight_ratings(speed, glide, turn, fade, throw_speed, plastic_type, release_angle):
    """
    Adjust the flight ratings of a disc based on the throw speed, plastic type, and release angle.

    Parameters:
        speed (float): The original speed rating of the disc.
        glide (float): The original glide rating of the disc.
        turn (float): The original turn rating of the disc.
        fade (float): The original fade rating of the disc.
        throw_speed (float): The speed of the throw in mph.
        plastic_type (str): The type of plastic the disc is made from.
        release_angle (float): The release angle of the disc in degrees (-45 to +45).

    Returns:
        dict: Adjusted flight ratings with turn and fade modified.
